# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Using CNN


In this project, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we can read and understand traffic signs which is a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.


Firstly, Traffic sign recognition uses a forward-facing video camera mounted in the area of the rearview mirror to permanently monitor road traffic signs.

Secondly, if a traffic sign is recognized, this is tracked and displayed in the instrument panel or on the monitor of the navigation unit/infotainment system when the vehicle passes the sign
